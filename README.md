Superfund sites are areas of land that contain contamination from hazarous substances and pollutants. The EPA designates and manages cleanup of these sites since the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980. This map only includes sites on the final national priorities list and does not include proposed or deleted sites.
